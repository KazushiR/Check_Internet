# Check_Internet
This script allows me to check to see if my internet has been down recently and sends me a notification if it went down. There is a .env file that I uploaded the passwords from and a txt file. The primary function of the txt file is to check if an email has been sent to me to let me know the internet is down. The script continously monitors an email system I set up that sends me an email from a server every 5 minutes. If it doesn't get that email, an external server sends me an email notifying me that the internet is down.
